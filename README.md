Website is accessible at: https://somya-pradhan.github.io/Project-ALarm-Clock/

**Project Description**
In this project, I have tried to achieve all the functionalities of a normal alarm clock. To accomplish this, I utilized my logic along with some of the built-in functions of JavaScript. To make it more user interactive i have used some basic animations. 

**Some Inbuilt Functions Which I Used:**
1. setInterval(): Executes a function repeatedly at specified intervals.
2. setTimeout(): Executes a function once after a specified delay.
3. play(): Used to play audio or video content.
4. alert(): Displays a dialog box with a specified message.
5. getHours(): Retrieves the hour component of a date object.
6. getMinutes(): Retrieves the minute component of a date object.
7. toString(): Converts an object to a string.
8. padStart(): Pads the start of a string with a specified character until the resulting string reaches the desired length.

**Features:**
1. The Clock Face: Displays the real-time time of the device in a 12-hour format.
2. Set Alarm Add Button: Upon clicking, it sets the alarm.
3. Delete Button: Used to delete previously set alarms.
4. Alerts: When the alarm time corresponds with the current time displayed on the clock a message is alerted.
5. Play Sound : When the alarm time corresponds with the current time displayed on the clock a sound is played to capture the user's attention.
